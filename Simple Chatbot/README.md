## Project Overview
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based chatbot using the DialoGPT-medium model from Microsoft. The chatbot learns from user interactions by using a Q-learning algorithm with a policy network. The reward function is based on sentiment analysis, which provides feedback on the quality of the bot's responses.

The chatbot is built using:
* **PyTorch** for the RL components.
* **Hugging Face** Transformers for the pre-trained DialoGPT model.
* **Streamlit** for the user interface.
